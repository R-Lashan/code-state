    <h1 class='heading'>History of Web Development</h1>
    <p class="para">Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, born in London, invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Lee’s parents were early computer scientists who had worked for the earliest computers, 
    While working at CERN, the large particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, Lee noticed that people were having challenges in sharing information. They need to log in to different computers to get the information they need. This is quite challenging because some computers require them to learn a computer language, which is not easy.  
    Lee thought of using hypertext to exploit the emerging technology that can help them share information to solve the problem. He proposed a project, but it wasn’t accepted at first. However, Lee was allowed to work on the project in September 1990. He began the work using a NeXT computer, one of Steve Jobs’ early products.
    By October of 1990, Lee had written the three fundamental technologies that work as the foundation of today’s web..</p>

    <p class="para">Computer programming began on a large scale during 1960's.Programming can be done using many languages.These languages are broadly classified into 3 types :
        <ul class="para">
            <li>
                <b>Machine Languages</b>

            <li>
                <b>Assembly Languages</b>      
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>High Level Languages</b>

        </ul>

    <h1 class="heading2">How to learn Programming </h1>
    <p class="para2">Though programming is when you are gathering the requirements, talking to all the people involved in the app, talking to the clients, analyzing all the different things that the app should do.You must know  how to communicate with the computer.We use computer languages to communicate with computer.Every one of those languages solves a problem in a different domain or is particularly well suited in some situations.    JavaScript is the main language of the Web. It’s the only language that browsers can execute inside Web pages.
    Python and Ruby are mainly used on Web servers, or as more general purpose languages. Python is well known in the data science community.</p>
